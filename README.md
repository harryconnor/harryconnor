## Hi, I’m Harry 👋

I'm a MEng Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Southampton.

I build models with: `Python` `MATLAB` `SQL` `C/C++` `Zsh/Bash` `Git` ... 

I make educational videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@harryconnorai) where I share what I’m learning in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.

I also enjoy reading, playing drums, and going for walks.
